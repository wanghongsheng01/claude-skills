# Claude skills

## academic-latex-polish
Polishes the English of a LaTeX research paper to the register of published PVLDB/SIGMOD papers. It does not change any fact, number, macro, citation or reference. A preservation checker verifies this after every edited file.

  scripts/style_stats.py    compare sentence length, parentheses and semicolons with published papers
```
